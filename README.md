# Lab7
### Executive Summary 
In this lab it talks about the similarities and differences in what a zip file is and what an unzipped one is. Also in this lab it talks about all the different types of shark methods to coding. besides all that it walked about the difference in shark class and shark object and how they are different and smile in a way along with how they work with one and another
###  File Compression. 
After reading about what a zip file and a unzip file is, it reminds me like when I want to delete a bunch of photos on my iphone I can hold and slide up instead of clicking each one. A zip file holds lots of documents and acts as if it is one because it is faster to send if needed to be and you can add a password if it's important stuff.
I was trying to do the next step but for some reason it was not letting me but i think i know why difference in file size for a svg file vs. what i might experience if the file were a jpg file and it might be because of the quality of the picture and even maybe the size of it. 
The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.
class is when a programmer creates it so i think this means after a programer codes a sit or something that called the class 
The objective is when it takes the class (the coding) and sets it for us and makes the class setup so it can perform what was coded to do.

### Python OOP 
Objects are typically part of a group of similar items called classes.
inherentes reduces programming labor by using common objects easily.
